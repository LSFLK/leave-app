# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Leave Management System (User Web App + Admin Portal)

**Technologies:**

- **Frontend (Web):** Vite + React
- **Backend:** Ballerina
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** Choreo
- **API Integration:** RESTful APIs built in Ballerina

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements for the Leave Management System, which enables employees to submit leave requests via a web app and allows administrators to manage, approve, or reject those requests through a web-based admin portal. The system also provides reporting functionalities for both users and administrators, offering summarized data about leave types, durations, and statuses.

### 1.2 Scope

The system includes:

- **User Web App:** Employees apply for leave, view status, and generate personal leave reports.
- **Admin Portal:** Administrators view, approve, or reject leave requests and generate organizational reports.
- **Backend Service (Ballerina):** Handles business logic, database operations, and API communication.
- **Database:** Stores user info, leave records, and approval statuses.

**Key Features:**

- User authentication and authorization
- Leave request management
- Real-time synchronization between user app and admin portal
- Report generation and data export

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

This is a two-sided client-server application:

```
+-----------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
|  User Web App   | <---> | Ballerina Backend| <---> |   Database (SQL) |
+-----------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
                                   ^
        __________________________ |
        v
+----------------+
|  Admin Portal  |
+----------------+
```

- **Frontend:** Vite apps communicate with Ballerina backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend:** Ballerina interacts with the relational database to persist leave data.

### 2.2 Product Functions

#### A. User Web App

- Login / Logout
- Apply for leave (select type, select portion of day, date range, reason, select people/groups to notify, additional comments(optional))
- View applied leave history
- View current leave status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Edit or cancel pending leave
- Generate leave report by date range or type

#### B. Admin Portal

- Admin login
- Dashboard view: all pending leaves
- Approve or disapprove leaves
- Filter leaves by status, user, or date
- Generate reports for all employees or a selected employee
- Export reports (PDF/CSV)

#### C. Backend (Ballerina)

- REST API endpoints for user and admin
- Database integration (SQL)
- Authentication and session management
- Business rules for leave approval workflow
- Reporting logic and data aggregation

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Type     | Description                                             | Access           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Employee/User | Registered employee using the web app to submit leaves | Web App          |
| Admin         | HR/admin staff who review and approve leaves            | Admin Web Portal |

### 2.4 Operating Environment

| Component    | Technology       | Environment |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Web App      | Vite + React     | Web browser |
| Admin Portal | Vite + React     | Web browser |
| Backend      | Ballerina        | Cloud/local |
| Database     | MySQL/PostgreSQL | Cloud/local |

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- Backend must be written in Ballerina.
- Frontend must use Vite.
- Database should use SQL schema.
- API communication via REST and JSON.
- Secure authentication (JWT or session tokens).

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Internet connectivity is available.
- User data is already available or registered in the system.
- Admin rights are assigned manually via database or configuration.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Authentication

- **FR1.1:** Users can login with email & password.
- **FR1.2:** System verifies credentials during login.
- **FR1.3:** Uses JWT/session tokens for authentication.
- **FR1.4:** Passwords are hashed before storing in the database.

  - Start date, end date
  - Reason
  - Porttion of the day
  - People/Groups to notify
  - Additional comment(optional)
- **FR2.2:** Request is stored in the database with status = "Pending".
